III. LITERATURE SURVEY
Various methods and techniques have been proposed to overcome the problem of parking in the congested areas.
Ming-Yee Chiu et al. proposed a method for counting the vehicles at the checkpoint from which the number of
available parking spaces can be counted. The counting is performed by installation of the induction loop sensors under
the road surface. Although the usage of sensors was less costly, not easily affected by environmental conditions and
it detects accurately however, it installation was difficult and cause damage to roads. It was also difficult to maintain
it in case of malfunction. Moreover, the exact locations of free parking area cannot be determined because the counting
method is not able to give the detail information, it just records the number of vehicles passing the checkpoints.
The other kinds of detection methods are presented based on vision-based methods. Through vision-based methods,
the whole parking area available for parking can be examined though the camera, the data is than processed and the
result generated will determine the exact number and location of the free parking spaces. Zhang Bin et al. proposed
that vision-based parking space detection methods are very easy to install, low in cost and the detector can be easily
adjusted according to requirements. Moreover, the data obtained from images is very rich. However, the defects in
the vision method are that the accuracy is highly dependent upon the position of the camera.
The other detection methods were based on use of sensors like ultrasonic, infrared and microwave for the detection
of vehicles. These sensors are placed beneath every parking space. Wan-Joo Park et al. proposed the use of ultrasonic
sensors mounted on the cars to search for a free parking space. The disadvantage of this method was that the sensors
are easily affected by weather conditions like rain, temperature, snow and fast air breeze. Another method was
presented by Vamsee K. Boda et al. based on wireless sensor nodes. This method was less costly and it uses the
wireless sensor nodes implemented at the critical places like the lane turns, entrance and exit positions of the parking
lot. The total number of cars in the parking area can be determined by the difference of incoming and outgoing cars.
