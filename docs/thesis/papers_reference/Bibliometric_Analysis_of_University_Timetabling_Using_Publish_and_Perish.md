ABSTRACT
The University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP) is rated as the main enemy by the University. UCTP aims to
allocate academic courses to lecturers, the division of time, and classrooms that must carry out regularly. So that learning activities run well and smoothly until achieving an increase in the quality of education. This study recommends
bibliometric analysis for this problem. Doing this is necessary to see trends or research gaps that are still possible.
Search data using Publish and perish software, while data analysis using VOSviewer software. The search and data
analysis results show that trend for the university timetabling problem is more likely to be solved by metaheuristic
models such as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing.

Keywords: Bibliometric Analysis, UCTP, VOSviewer, Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing

1. INTRODUCTION
University faces course scheduling problems as
the main villain since complexity in constructing the
university timetabling. The University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP) is allocating lecturers, students,
and courses into rooms in a span of periods. Moreover,
the activities must carry out regularly to run well and
smoothly until achieving an increase in the quality of
education.
Furthermore, we conduct this study to measure
the inter-relationships and impacts of publications
within a given area of research, especially in UCTP.
Several limitations of the research area are fundamental courses such as assignments comparison, lecturer
attendance, and lecturers' skill levels comparison [1].
Some other manifest courses as follows: (1) comparison of assignments to the total number of courses; (2)
the comparison of class capacity to the capacity of
classrooms; (3) the ratio of permanent lecturers to the
total number of lecturers; (4) and the comparison of the
number of classrooms assigned to each lecturer to the
total index of classroom comparisons ready to use [2].
A schedule complex problem is a particular issue
trying to find a possible allocation to demand a univer-

sity education. However, universities have limited resources, so they need proper management. Moreover,
creating a university schedule is also a complex process that takes the available resources into account.
Suppose the schedule distribution without an appropriate calculation of the available resources will impact
waste in utilization. Especially if there is no re-evaluation technique for the schedule. Availability or utilization of space becomes invalid due to a lack of timely
information. Early provision of information regarding
the timing of space utilization is substantial for making
an accurate schedule [3].
This study does not discuss methods or ways to
make scheduling at universities but provide a bibliometric review. It shows trends and research potential
in the university timetable. Thus, bibliometric studies
are commonly applied to skills that focus on quantitative studies of journal papers, books, or other types of
writing [4]. As far as our knowledge, the discussion in
this study does not have publications that publish a bibliometric analysis of the term "University Course
Timetabling Problem (UCTP)". Moreover, this study
uses the citation level to assess the academic quality of
the journal or author.

The construction of this paper is as follows. In section
2 explains the literature review of UCTP. While section 3 provides the methodology of bibliometric analysis, along with the steps of the method. Section 4 presents the results and discussion. The last section presents the recommendations, conclusions, and limitations of the study.

1.1 Literature Review
This section presents a brief literature review and
closely related works. The timetabling problem is a
complex problem experienced by a university or other
education institutions. According to [5] in the timetabling issue, it consists of at least four parameters, i.e.,
limited time, limited resources, number of meetings,
and limited number of constraints. Many combinations
of these parameters result in timetabling, including
university timetabling, an NP-hard problem that will
take a long time to solve manually [6].
Timetabling at the university divided into course
scheduling and exam schedule. Course scheduling often discusses the distribution of time, rooms, and lecturers. In contrast, exam scheduling discusses a certain
amount of time in a limited number of rooms. Research
on course scheduling was carried out by [6], [7], [8],
[9], [10]. Meanwhile, [11], and [12] discussed exam
scheduling.
In every university, it is necessary to carry out a
schedule of courses carried out at almost every semester ended. The course scheduling problem is commonly referred to as University Timetable Problem.
Moreover, course scheduling at a university is different
to others. It’s because each university has different
constraints and issues that each university must fulfil.
The university prepares course scheduling by coordinating different elements, for example, employees, students, teachers, subjects, etc., in a span of periods.
Since the university faces the repeated activities each
semester, this problem repeatedly arises. Especially
when lectures or exams with different subjects meet institutional conditions or situations. Both students and
teachers need to comply with them properly [10], [13].
University timetabling has a wid,e variety of
complexities. Several studies describe the wide variety
of complexity. For example, the consequences of improper scheduling for students with different semesters
can cause schedules to clash [14]. There are several
choices of algorithmic approaches that can be applied
to solve the university timetabling problem. One practical approach is the use of meta-heuristics, such as genetic algorithms and data retrieval technologies that
successfully
provide
optimization
solutions
[15],[16],[17]. They present the university schedule

problem as lecturer allocation, division of planned time
and class. Moreover, the calculation shows that the recommended algorithm can get a solution that is close to
the right compared to the solution generated manually
[18].
Furthermore, university timetabling literature review studies are hard to find. Theppakorn and
Pongcharoen identify 14 hard constraints and 18 soft
constraints from the previous researches [3]. The
widely used hard constraints are: (1) Students can only
have one lecture at a time; (2) A lecturer can only deliver one lecture at a time; and (3) Lecturers’ unavailability is considered. Moreover, the widely used soft
constraints are: (1) The timetables for rooms should be
as compact as possible; (2) Lecturers can specify times
when they prefer not to lecture; (3) Some lectures
should not take place late in the evening; (4) The number of students having lunch at a given time should be
controlled; (5) Classes should have lectures either in
the morning or in the afternoon.
The limited studies of literature reviews on the
UCTP area creates opportunities to see how the researches are going and what recommended urgencies
the UCTP nowadays. The new world situations such as
pandemics and lecture modes also provide opportunities that might influence the direction of the research
in UCTP.

2. METHODS
We conduct the methodology of this research using five steps in Ilhami et al. (2019) [19]. We present
the five steps in detail as follows.

2.1 Defining Search Keyword
Bibliometric screening is arranged based on keywords in the course schedule. Search keywords including “course scheduling” and “university timetable”.
Thus, we exclude course schedules at school or training programs.

2.2 Initial Search Result
We conduct the initial search using Publish and
Perish Software version 7.32.3373.7310, with applying Google Scholar and Scopus database. The search
process begins by using the keyword “course scheduling”. From the Scopus database resulted in 200 articles, while the Google Scholar database has 998 articles. And then we tried with the keyword “university
timetable”. With this keyword, the Scopus database
found 200 articles. Finally, the Google Scholar database discover 999 papers.

Furthermore, we find that publish and perish software shows the exploration with the Google Scholar
database provide more articles than the Scopus database. This is caused by publish or perish software limits to 1000 articles of the Google Scholar database.
While using the Scopus database, articles are limited
to 200 articles.

2.3 Refinement of Search Result
At this stage, we conduct a selection of the existing articles. The refinement criteria used in this study
are as follows.
1. Articles are from journals.
2. The citation value is above four.
3. The abstract fits the UCTP problem.
After conducting the refinement, we find 14 articles in the Google Scholar database and 23 articles in
the Scopus database that match the UCTP problem.
Moreover, we find 47 articles in the Google Scholar
database and 17 articles in the Scopus database while
using the keyword university timetabling. Table 1
shows the results of article refinement.

2.4 Compiling the Initial Data Statistics
After the refinement process, the next step is to
download all the remaining articles in CSV (commaseparated value) format. This format is required to
combine the remaining articles from Scopus and
Google Scholar databases easily. Furthermore, by using this method we may complete all metadata we need
to provide a better source for mapping the remaining
articles. Moreover, we may make sure there is only one
unique data in the CSV file. Finally, we find 62 unique
articles in the CSV file. Fig. 1 shows the grouping of
the 62 articles by year.

Figure 1. The grouping articles by year
Furthermore, we conduct these 62 articles mapping using VOSviewer software. We analyze the mapping results using “Co-occurrence” which displays a
visualization of the network between keywords. While
the calculation method to find out the most dominant
references uses "full counting", which counts the articles as they are.
VOSviewer provides a visualization of the dataset, in this case, a journal article. VOSviewer software provides three visualization outputs, which are:
(1) network visualization; (2) overlay visualization;
and (3) density visualization.

2.5 Data Analysis
Articles search with Publish and Perish Software
version 7.32.3373.7310 is processed using PC with Inter® Core™ i5-8265U CPU @ 1.60GHz 1.80 GHz,
8.00 GB RAM. Under the 64-bit operating system,
X64-based processor. Search results with Google
Scholar yielded nearly 900 articles and 200 articles
from the Scopus database. The compiling results of the
initial data statistics of the two finally present 62 papers with the keywords course scheduling and university scheduling.

3. RESULT AND DISCUSSION
Based on the visualization from VOSviewer, we
knew that research on university timetabling is quite in
demand. The solution to this university timetabling
problem uses more heuristic and metaheuristic methods. It can be seen from the mapping of existing articles. Fig. 2 shows a visualization of the VOSviewer.

Figure 2. Overlay visualization university timetabling
Figure 2 shows that the large circle image is the
item that often appears in VOSviewer is "integer programming", then "university course timetabling" and
"course timetabling". The colours in the overlay visualization show the current trend in university timetabling problems. Dark colours indicate previous events
or trends. Meanwhile the lighter colours indicate current trends in the research area.
The lighter colour as expressed in Figure 2 are
genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA).
These methods belong to metaheuristic algorithm
group. The genetic algorithm known as an effective algorithm for solving NP-hard problem. While the simulated annealing algorithm is still less popular than genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithms work on the principles of genetics. While the SA algorithm moves
based on temperature increase in the steel annealing
process.
Research trends in university timetabling problem are in this area. Completion of solutions is prioritized by using heuristic and metaheuristic models rather than making mathematical models. We may combine the two metaheuristic models to produce a more
efficient solution. Such as by changing the rules for
generating parameters, which merges the two algorithms. However, mathematical models can still be
used as an alternative. Especially, to describe the university timetabling problems in detail.

4. CONCLUSIONS
This study investigates bibliometrics for university scheduling. We used Publish and perish software

to search for initial articles and then performed analysis using VOSviewer. The search for articles was carried out in 2017-2021 using the keywords university
timetabling and course timetabling. Tracking did use
Google Scholar and Scopus databases, with inclusion
criteria: (1) 2017 – present, (2) subject area: computer
science, mathematics, and decision science, (3) limited
to journal.
There are 62 relevant articles in this study. The
results show that there are still research gaps, especially regarding the proposal improvement of solution
method especially in genetic algorithm and simulated
annealing. Keyword “course timetabling” and “university timetabling” often represented by several keywords and could lead to a miss calculation of occurrences and total link strength. Thus, we can use another
keyword.
