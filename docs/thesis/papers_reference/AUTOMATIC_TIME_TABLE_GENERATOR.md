ABSTRACT :- This project is aimed at developing
a Time Table Generator for Colleges. Timetable
generation is a very well known problem that is
faced in every educational institution. Most
colleges have a number of different courses and
each course has a number of subjects. Now there
are limited faculties, each faculty teaching more
than one subjects. So now the time table needed to
schedule the faculty at provided time. slots in such
a way that their timings do not overlap and the time
table schedule, makes best use of all faculty subject
demands. The Automatic Timetable Generator
system will take various inputs like details of
faculty, students, subjects and depending upon
these inputs it will generate a possible time table,
making optimal utilization of all resources in a way
that will best suit the specified constraints or
college rules. Automatic Timetable Generator
system is an automated system which generates
time table according to the data given by the user.
The main requirement of the application is to
provide the details about the branch, semester,
subjects, labs and total no. of periods. system is an
automated system which generates time table
according to the data given by the user. . The main
requirement of the application is to provide the
details about the branch, semester, subjects, labs
and total no. of periods. List of subjects may
include electives as well as core subjects .Students
need to elect their electives if any. Then the
application generates the time table according to
your need.

I.INTRODUCTION
IJCRT2405777

Planning timetables is one of the most complex and
error-prone applications. There are still serious
problems like generation of high cost time tables
are occurring while scheduling and these problems
are repeating frequently. There for there is a great
requirement for an application distributing the
course evenly and without collisions. Our aim here
is to develop a simple, easily understandable,
efficient and portable application, which could
automatically
generate
good
quality
timetables with in seconds. Sure, an automatic
timetable generator using Python and Tkinter is a
tool designed to create schedules for various
activities or events. Tkinter is a standard GUI
(Graphical User Interface) toolkit for Python,
providing a set of tools for building graphical
applications. The automatic timetable generator
typically takes input parameters such as the list of
activities, their durations, and any constraints or
preferences, and then generates an optimized
timetable that meets these criteria. Using Tkinter,
users can interact with the application through
buttons, text fields, and other graphical elements to
input data and view the generated timetable. The
generator algorithm then processes this input to
produce an efficient timetable layout, which can be
displayed within the Tkinter interface or exported
to other formats for printing or further use. Overall,
this project combines the power of Python for
algorithmic processing with Tkinter for creating a
user-friendly interface, resulting in a handy tool for
generating timetables quickly and efficiently.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW
In This paper is focused on the development of a
Time Table Generator for Colleges. Timetable
technology is a well-known issue that affects every
academic institution. The problem arises as a result
of disagreements, with some of the options
provided by the staff. Colleges are expected to
create timetables for each semester that change as
quickly as a fully new semester.. Administrators
added the important factors for adding the Student,
add Staff, add Subject, Time Table Entry, Time
Table Update [1]
In This paper Time table generation is tedious job
for educationalist with respect to time and man
power. Providing a automatic time table generator
will help to generate time table automatically.
Proposed system of our project will help to
generate it automatically also helps to save time. It
avoids the complexity of setting and managing
Timetable manually. In our project we are going to
use algorithms like genetic, heuristic, resource
scheduling to reduce these difficulties of generating
timetable. [2]
In This paper Generating timetable for university
with many branches, different years, and multiple
batches is a tiresome job. It takes a lot of time and
is required for every semester that is of six months.
Thus, a lot of time and manpower is taken up by
this process. In some cases, the manual process of
creating timetables is too cumbersome. Creating
temporary timetables when a faculty is on leave is
impractical. In this paper, we have created an
algorithm to generate timetables which can save a
lot of time and pressure on the person doing this job
manually. [3]

Integrating AI and machine learning techniques can
enable the system to learn from past schedules and
user preferences, thereby improving its ability to
generate optimal timetables. Predictive analytics
can be used to anticipate scheduling conflicts and
suggest alternative solutions.
Mobile Applications: Developing mobile
applications for Android and iOS platforms can
extend the reach of the timetable generator,
allowing users to access and manage schedules on
their smartphones and tablets. Mobile apps can
offer additional features such as push notifications,
calendar integration, and offline access.
V. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, an automatic timetable generator
created with Tkinter in Python offers a robust
solution for efficiently managing schedules across
various domains. Its future scope is promising, with
opportunities for enhancement and expansion in
several areas:
User Experience: Improving the user interface and
