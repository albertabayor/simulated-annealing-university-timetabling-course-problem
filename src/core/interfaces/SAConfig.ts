  // ============================================
  //
  // Intensification is an aggressive Phase 1.5 that targets remaining hard violations
  // when Phase 1 doesn't achieve zero violations. It uses focused operator selection
  // and multiple restart attempts to eliminate stubborn violations.
  //
  // How it works:
  // 1. Triggered when Phase 1 ends with hardViolations > 0
  // 2. Each attempt runs for intensificationIterations with focused operator selection
  // 3. Uses targeted operators (fix/swap/change) 70% of time, all operators 30%
  // 4. Aggressively accepts moves that reduce hard violations
  // 5. Reheats if stagnation detected (300 iterations without improvement)
  // 6. Stops early when all hard violations eliminated
  // 7. Up to maxIntensificationAttempts restart attempts
  //
  // When to use (enabled by default):
  // - Problems with complex, conflicting constraints
  // - Hard constraints are difficult to satisfy
  // - Phase 1 frequently ends with remaining violations
  //
  // When to disable:
  // - Simple problems where Phase 1 consistently reaches zero violations
  // - Quick approximate solutions are acceptable
  // - Soft constraints are more important than hard constraint feasibility
